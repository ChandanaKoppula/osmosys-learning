## Purpose of this document

- This document serves as a guideline and is not intended to be a tutorial.

## Task 1 - Understanding how browsers and a server communicate via  Web Browser.

The web is distributed, one system sitting on one part of the globe connects to another via the Internet. 
 The **client** sends a request to the **server**. The server processes the request and sends a  response back to the client. Read more about it here -

## Task 5 - [Quick Crash Course] Tutorials on the PHP.NET website

The best place to continue now would be to complete the following tuts - 

1. http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.firstpage.php
2. http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.useful.php
3. http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.forms.php

7. Handling data from form on the server based on the method/action attribute. (REQUEST)
8. `htmlspecialchars()` librabry function.
8. Sending a response back to the client.

## Task 6 - Data Types in PHP

Best place to start on Data Types would be to go through - http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.php

Our recommendation would be to cover atleast till the `NULL` data type and then to go through Type Juggling - http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php

#### By the end of this task you should be able to understand -

1. Identify the various data types allowed by PHP.

## Task 7 - Variables in PHP

Read up on variables from here - http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php  

You can skip the section **Vairable Variable**
For **Variables From External Sources** cover only the GET and POST section.

### By the end of it, you should be familiar with - 

- Declaring variables and assigning them values.
- How scoping of variables works in PHP

## Task 8 - Constants in PHP 

Read here - http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.php

### By the end of it, you should be familiar with - 

- How to declare, access a constant
- Knowledge of some magic constants such as `__FILE__`, `__DIR__`, `__LINE__` etc.

## Task 9 - Let's build a shopping cart for a Supermarket.

The supermarket will currently have a predefined list of items, to which there is no possibility (for now) to add things.

You'll create a form with the following controls/labels - 

| Label | Control (For Quantity) | Price (As Label) |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Tooth Brush | Textbox | 40 |
| Tooth Paste | Textbox | 60 |
| Hand wash | Textbox | 55 |
| Cocunut Hair Oil | Textbox | 60 |
| Bathing Soap | Textbox | 25 |

Put a heading on top of your form, with a name for your supermarket. At the bottom of the form add a submit (text should be **Buy**) button. Ensure that the `action` and `method` attribute are set correctly. (Method should be POST)

Now in your PHP page, you've to calculate the total price (price * quantity) for each item and display it to the end user.

At the bottom you will also display a Total column that will be the sum of all the prices.

Your output should be a table of the following type - 

| Item | Quantity | Price | Total |
|----------------|------|------|-------|
| Tooth Brush | 3 | 40 | 120 |
| Bathing Soap | 3 | 25 | 75 |
| **Total** | | | 195 |

**Further Tips/Hints** -
- Ensure your text-boxes have the html `name` attribute. It's a common mistake to forget these.
- Ensure your form's method is `POST`
- Access form variables in PHP using `$_POST`
- Use constants to define the prices of various objects.
- Generate each row of the table (except for the header row) in a `for` loop
- Ideally your code to calculate and generate the table should be a function.

### By the end of it, you should be familiar with - 

1. Access values from textboxes in an HTML page.
2. The `$_POST` variable
3. Writing specific focused functions.


## Task  10 : A slightly improved shopping cart.

OK, so we are comfortable working with text-boxes, it's time to move onto some other HTML controls.

1. We'll add a check-box at the bottom of our form (but above the submit button). The label of the check-box will be **Want a paper-bag?**
2. The price column will now become a drop-down that will contain different prices for different products. For example Tooth Paste might have three prices - 60, 55, 50. The user can select which **type** of toothpaste he wants. These values will be predefined and populated in the HTML.
